I implemented the extension for boringSSL, added support to Cloudflare's edge servers, and helped develop the standard. Once browsers adopt it, this extension will make TLS more secure in practice. One problem with short-lived credentials is that client-clock skew limits their effective lifetime. To help address this, I also deployed the [Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime) protocol, which is now [live](https://blog.cloudflare.com/roughtime/)."
